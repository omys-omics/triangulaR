### Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibirum states that under neutral evolutionary assumptions, the genotype frequencies ($p_{11}$, $p_{12}$, $p_{22}$) in the next generation are given by the allele frequencies in the current generation. Allele frequencies are denoted as $p_1$ and $p_2$, but when there are only two alleles at a locus, $p_2$ can be written as $1-p_1$, yielding the following equations for genotype frequencies.
$$
p_{11} = p_1^2
$$
$$
p_{12} = 2p_1(1-p_1)
$$
$$
p_{22} = (1-p_1)^2
$$
Let's consider the hybrid index and interclass heterozygosity of individuals at sites that are fixed for alternate alelles in the parental populations. When only considering fixed differences, it follows that hybrid index equates to the frequency of p1 alleles across the genome. Similarly, interclass heterozygosity equates to the frequency of p1p2 genotypes across the genomes.

When the parents have the same hybrid index, they can be thought of similarly as a population that is in HWE, and the above formulas can be used to calculate the hybrid index and interclass heterozygosity of offspring. For example,  let's consider a cross between two F1s. Both parents have a hybrid index of 0.5, which means the frequency of the $p_1$ allele across the genome is 0.5. Using only this information, we can calculate the genome-wide genotype frequencies of the offspring (F2s).

$$
p_{11} = 0.5^2 = 0.25
$$
$$
p_{12} = 2(0.5)(1-0.5) = 0.5
$$
$$
p_{22} = (1-0.5)^2 =0.25
$$
From the genotype frequencies of the offspring, we can obtain the frequency of the $p_1$ allele by dividing the frequency of $p_12$ genotype by $2$ (because the $p_1$ allele only occurs once in that genotype) and summing with the frequency of the $p_11$ genotype:
$$
p_1 = 0.5(p_{12}) + p_{11} = 0.5(0.5) + 0.25 = 0.5
$$
Therefore, we obtain the expected hybrid index (0.5, frequency of the $p_1$ allele) and interclass heterozygosity (0.5, frequency of the $p_{12}$ genotype) in the F2 generation. 

However, for crosses between parents with different hybrid indices, we must slighly modify the above formulas, because the parents are no longer in HWE. To calculate the genotype frequencies for offspring in such cases, we must take into account the difference in hybrid index between the two parents. This is done by calculating the variance ($σ^2$) of the $p_1$ allele frequency in the two parents:
$$
σ^2 = \frac{Σ (p_{1i} − \overline{p_1})^2} {N}
$$
where $p_{1i}$ is the frequency of the $p_1$ allele in the $ith$ parent and $\overline{p_1}$ is the average frequency of the $p_1$ allele in the parents (Hahn, 2018). Genotype frequencies of offspring are then calculated as: 
$$
p_{11} = \overline{p_1}^2 - σ^2 
$$
$$
p_{12} = 2\overline{p_1}(1-\overline{p_1}) + 2σ^2 
$$
$$
p_{22} = (1-\overline{p_1})^2 - σ^2 
$$


Based on the above formulas, we can calculate the hybrid index and interclass heterozygosity of any offspring given only the average allele frequency of $p_1$ alleles in the parents. Try it out for yourself by adjusting the hybrid index and interclass heterozygosity of the parents, and seeing where the hybrid offspring would occur on a triangle plot:

The dashed line on the above triangle plot denotes the expected hybrid index and interclass heterozygosity under HWE. As you may have noticed, hybrid offspring will never occur below the dashed curve on the triangle plot. Why is that? We can understand this by considering two cases of crosses. In the first case, the parents have the same hybrid index. When this is the case, offspring will occur on the dashed line by definition, because the parents are in HWE. In the second case, the parents have different hybrid indices. In this case, the hybrid index of offspring will be the same as for a cross between parents of the average $p_1$ allele frequency, because the genotype frequencies $p_{11}$ and $p_{22}$ will decrease by the same increment ($σ^2$), and changes in the $p_{12}$ genotype frequency don't change the hybrid index. However, the interclass heterozygosity will be higher than for a cross between parents of the average $p_1$ allele frequency, because the $p_{12}$ genotype frequency will increase by $σ^2$. Thus, hybrid offspring will always occur above the dashed curve. Of course, this is assuming the assumptions of HWE hold. When any of the assumptions of HWE are violated, such as if there is selection, drift, or inbreeding, it would be possible for individuals to occur below the dashed curve.

### Triangle plots in practice

When analyzing empirical genetic datasets, there are a number of factors that will influence the accuracy and precision of estimated hybrid indices and interclass heterozygosity (Wiens & Colella, 2024).
